# Jalil Johnson Final Project Portfolio 

- Hello, my name is Jalil Johnson and I am a student programmer in Ap Comp-sci. I would say that i am a some what good programer and am having a fun time making games with code and learning about code.

- Over the past year, Iâ€™ve learned development tools, practiced writing clean and efficient code, and learned how to turn ideas into interactive digital experiences. I'm continuing to grow as a programmer and always looking for new challenges during the year.

- My project is a website with a modern look to it and a blue color to it. This website is made using Html and CSS codes in this folder. When hovering over the boxes where games are in you can see they can move and when clicking on the link it would bring you to the game you selected.
